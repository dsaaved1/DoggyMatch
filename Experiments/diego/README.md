# Experiment 

## Description

This is a web server with spring boot that can create new users and stores them in database. A new user can be created by making a POST request and with a GET request you can access all the data stored on the database. A new user requires a name written on the brackets "name: Diego" and it will be assigned with a new id and stored in the database as an object.
