## About

**DoggyMatch** is a way to connect with other owners on our safe and friendly platform to find the perfect playdate for your dog. Using our DoggyMatch algorithm, you'll find the perfect dog.  Sign up and sign in to match with other users and send them a chat to plan a play date.

DoggyMatch is a safe to use platform.  Users of DoggyMatch and its services will be able to view dogs and contact owners if the dogs are a match.  Use of non-dog images is not allowed.  We have three types of users.  Each user type serves its own role in the DoggyMatch ecosystem which allows for our services to run.  Our users are either Dog Owners, Moderators, or Admin.  The Dog Owner is in charge of uploading pictures of their dog and giving it a description so that they can find other dogs to match with theirs.  Moderators can view Dog Profiles and see specific ones more often based on their preferences.  Moderators can also report pages for inappropriate content which the Admin can choose to remove.  The admin see the most reported to least reported accounts which means that they can see accounts which have not yet been reported if they have already reviewed all which have been reported.

DoggyMatch has 3 specific features which make it stand out!  The first and most overlooked is preferencing.  The preferences you set will allow you to find the perfect playdate for your dog.  As a moderator, you can set preferences so that specific breeds or types of dogs will show up more often for you.  These preferences will show up most often and slowly work towards least preferernced.  Admin see most reported down to least reported but must have access to seeing all acounts so that they can report ones which may have gone unlooked.  Not just anybody can be an admin so they must go through a verification process.

**This app is for Dog Owners and Dog Lovers!** Anybody who cares about dogs will easily love this new app that allows them to see dogs so easily!  DoggyMatch is one of a kind.  There is no other app available to match dogs for playdates.  This exclusivity has allowed us to give users the first look at what a playdate experience should be.
